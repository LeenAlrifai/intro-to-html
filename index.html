<h2>About Me</h2>

width="300">



<p>My Name is Leen Alrifai. I am 20 years old and Syrian. I was born in Amman Jordan and moved to Canada when I was only 1 years old and
    lived in Toronto for 13 years. My family and I eventally had to move out of Toronto and decided to live in Ottawa in 2017. 
    In my free time I like to paint and watch shows. I am a fan of anime so most of my paintings I do are anime related. 
    I am a huge car enthusiast and hope one day I will be able to learn how to modify/buy all types of vehicals as a side hustle. 
    My favourite type of vehicals are JDMS, which stands for "Japanese Domestic Market." I own figures of some of my dream cars and I am 
    currently building a mini Supra MK4 kit.</p>

    <p2>One of my passions is Photography, I love taking photos of anything I find Aesthetically pleasing. One of my favourite things to 
    capture is the moon even though my Iphone 14 wont ever capture it's full potential, I still try everything I could to take a photo.
    Another passion of mine is editing shows and movies with my favourite songs. It is almost like thearpy and a good distraction or if 
    I am feeling really bored, I just spend time creating edits.</p2>
